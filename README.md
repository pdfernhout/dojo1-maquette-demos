# dojo1-maquette-demos
Demos using Maquette with Dojo1 in TypeScript

* hello-increasing-abstraction is intended to be a series of examples demonstrating moving from displaying plain HTML for content to eventually using specification-driven components editing content initially requested over the network. However, only the last one in the series is currently backported to Dojo1. The others are in the [Dojo2 version repo](https://github.com/pdfernhout/dojo2-maquette-demos).
* three-cube demonstrates the integration of three.js with Maquette and Dojo1. This same approach could be used to integrate dgrid or even any complex Dijit-based widget or form into a Maquette UI.

TODO:

* Add Maquette development dependency for node_modules instead of copying files by hand
* Backport other hello examples

Vendor:

* Dojo (Revised BSD license)
* Maquette (MIT license)
* three.js (MIT license)
